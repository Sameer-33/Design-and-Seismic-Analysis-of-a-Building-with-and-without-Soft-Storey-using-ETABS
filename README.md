# Design-and-Seismic-Analysis-of-a-Building-with-and-without-Soft-Storey-using-ETABS

In shaking a building, an earthquake ground motion will search for every structural 
weakness. These weaknesses are usually created by sharp changes in stiffness, strength 
and/or ductility, and the effects of these weaknesses are accentuated by poor distribution 
of reactive masses. Severe structural damage suffered by several modern buildings during 
recent earthquakes illustrates the importance of avoiding sudden changes in lateral 
stiffness and strength.  
A typical example of the detrimental effects that these discontinuities can induce is 
seen in the case of buildings with a “soft storey.” In our model by assigning the walls to 
the floors except the ground floor we can make a soft story model. Whare as a building 
with having the walls in every floor of the building then it will not be a soft story 
building.
